# How to Complete the GitHub Skills Learning Pathway

## What Has Been Done

This repository has been set up with the GitHub Skills "Introduction to GitHub" learning pathway, and the automated portions have been completed:

✅ **Step 0 - Welcome**: Repository initialized with course materials
✅ **Step 1 - Create a branch**: Branch `my-first-branch` has been created  
✅ **Step 2 - Commit a file**: File `PROFILE.md` added to `my-first-branch` with the message "Welcome to my GitHub profile!"

## What You Need to Do

To complete the learning pathway, follow these manual steps:

### Step 3: Open a Pull Request

1. Go to your repository on GitHub: https://github.com/kingdomseed/skills-introduction-to-github
2. Click on the **"Pull requests"** tab
3. Click the **"New pull request"** button
4. Select the branches:
   - **base**: `main`
   - **compare**: `my-first-branch`
5. Click **"Create pull request"**
6. Add a title: `Add my first file`
7. Add a description explaining what you've done
8. Click **"Create pull request"** to submit
9. Wait ~20 seconds and refresh - GitHub Actions will automatically update to Step 4!

### Step 4: Merge Your Pull Request

1. Once the pull request is created and any checks pass, click **"Merge pull request"**
2. Click **"Confirm merge"**
3. After merging, click **"Delete branch"** to clean up `my-first-branch`
4. Wait ~20 seconds and refresh - GitHub Actions will show the course as complete!

## Expected Outcome

After completing steps 3 and 4, you will have:

- ✅ Learned how to create branches
- ✅ Learned how to commit files
- ✅ Learned how to open pull requests
- ✅ Learned how to merge pull requests
- ✅ Created your first profile README (`PROFILE.md`)
- ✅ Completed the GitHub Skills "Introduction to GitHub" course!

## Troubleshooting

If the automation doesn't trigger:
- Make sure you're creating the PR from `my-first-branch` to `main` (not any other branch)
- Wait at least 20-30 seconds for GitHub Actions to run
- Check the "Actions" tab to see if workflows are running
- Refresh your repository's README.md page to see updated instructions

## Next Steps After Completion

Once you complete this course, consider:

1. Creating your own profile README in a repository named after your GitHub username
2. Taking another GitHub Skills course
3. Exploring open source projects to contribute to
4. Building your own projects on GitHub

Happy learning! 🎓
