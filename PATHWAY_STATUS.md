# GitHub Skills Learning Pathway Status

## Current Progress

The GitHub Skills "Introduction to GitHub" learning pathway has been set up and is ready for completion.

### Completed Steps:

- ✅ **Step 0 (Welcome)**: Initial repository setup complete
- ✅ **Step 1 (Create a branch)**: Branch `my-first-branch` has been created
- ✅ **Step 2 (Commit a file)**: File `PROFILE.md` has been added to `my-first-branch` with the content "Welcome to my GitHub profile!"

### Current Step:

📍 **Step 3 (Open a pull request)**: The repository is currently waiting for a pull request to be opened from `my-first-branch` to `main`.

### Next Actions Required:

To complete the learning pathway, the following steps need to be taken:

1. **Open a Pull Request**:
   - Create a new pull request from `my-first-branch` to `main`
   - Title: "Add my first file"
   - After the PR is opened, GitHub Actions will automatically progress to Step 4

2. **Merge the Pull Request** (Step 4):
   - Once the PR is reviewed and ready, merge it
   - Delete the `my-first-branch` branch after merging
   - GitHub Actions will automatically mark the course as complete

### Repository Structure:

- **Main Branch**: Contains the course materials and is at Step 3
- **my-first-branch**: Contains the PROFILE.md file ready to be merged
- **Automated Workflows**: GitHub Actions workflows are configured to automatically update the README.md with new instructions as you progress through each step

### Verification:

Current step number: **3** (verified in `.github/steps/-step.txt`)

Branch `my-first-branch` exists with commit history:
- Initial commit
- Update to 1 in STEP and README.md
- Update to 2 in STEP and README.md  
- Add welcome message to GitHub profile (PROFILE.md)
- Update to 3 in STEP and README.md

## How to Continue:
